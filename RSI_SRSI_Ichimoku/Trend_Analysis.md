<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>The following is a project on creating a trading strategy utilizing the existing trend indicators.<br>
Here we select the famous <strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</strong> and <strong>Stochastic RSI (SRSI)</strong> for the basis of our strategy and the indicator <strong>Ichimoku</strong> for a comparison.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><strong>RSI</strong> and <strong>SRSI</strong> behave very differently even though one is based on another. The <strong>RSI</strong> is a stable, low-volatile indicator used for trend confirmation and predictions over long-term historical data. Meanwhile, the <strong>RSI</strong> is a highly sensitive and volatile indicator that frequently reaches its extreme values. By using the strong confirmation of the <strong>RSI</strong> in conjunction with the rapid arbitrage of the <strong>SRSI</strong>, we can achieve a strong trend signal with reliable results.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p><strong>Ichimoku</strong> being a well-renowned indicator for its low-volatile, consistent returns gave a <strong>14.3%</strong> profit return in the <em>Nifty-50</em> stock over our sample trading period. It performed a total of 187 trades.<br>
Meanwhile, our strategy achieved a net total of <strong>31%</strong> returns over the same situation, making 57 total trades out of which 29 were profitable.</p>
